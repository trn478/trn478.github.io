What is Convolutional Neural Network(CNNs)?
----------

Convolutional neural network are used to find patterns in a given image. Through convolution over an image, for pixels in rows and column of the image, seeking suitable patterns. Layers in CNNs that helps the model identify images.

What does CNNs do?
-------------------

Through convolution over an image, for pixels in rows and column of the image, seeking suitable patterns.
Layers in CNNs that helps the model identify images. To elaborate, in the first few layers of CNNs, the network identifies 
 lines and corners. Then, we pass these patterns to the next layer through neural networks and start recognizing more complex 
 features as we get deeper into the neural network. This is similar to how our own brain works. We first identify the 
 appearance of the object and then classify it, based on the complex knowledge in our memory. The ability to use multiple 
 layers makes CNNs exceptional at detecting objects in high dimensional images.

Where is it used?
-------------------

CNNs was a major breakthrough for AI, it has made massive improvements possible for certain stagnant fields of Machine Learning, such as neural network. CNNs enabled developers with the capability of providing the end-user with more personalized products and services.

## Main Fields using CNN

1) **Self-driving** cars using Object detection

2) **Personalized** Medicine

3) **Recommendation** Programs used by YouTube, Amazon, Netflix, etc.

4) Natural Language Processing (**NLP**)


Layers in CNNs

Basic Implementation & Demonstration using Keras
------------------------

-   First download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

-   Install Keras using pip

      pip install keras

Key Takeaway & Summary
------------------

-   ConvNets represents a major accomplishment for Artificial Intelligence and will be used well into the future. Understanding how CNNs models operate can help us understand how we learn as human beings.

-    The general public thinks companies like Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and other large car companies are the ones who is inventing self-driving cars with amazing features. However, we should never forget the researchers, such as Geoffery Hilton, who made the modern technology possible.
