What is Convolutional Neural Network(CNNs)?
----------

Convolutional neural network are used to find patterns in a given image. Through convolution over an image, for pixels in rows and column of the image, seeking suitable patterns. Layers in CNNs that helps the model identify images. 


Where is it used?
-------------------

CNNs was a major breakthrough for AI, it has made massive improvements possible for certain stagnant fields of Machine Learning, such as neural network. CNNs enabled developers with the capability of providing the end-user with more personalized products and services.

## Main Fields using CNN

1) **Self-driving** cars using Object detection

2) **Personalized** Medicine

3) **Recommendation** Programs used by YouTube, Amazon, Netflix, etc.

4) Natural Language Processing (**NLP**) used by Siri, and many others


Basic Implementation & Demonstration using Keras
------------------------

-   First download [Python]()

-   Install Keras using pip

      pip install keras


Visualization
------------------


Key Takeaway & Summary
------------------

-   ConvNets represents a major accomplishment for Artificial Intelligence and will be used well into the future. Understanding how CNNs models operate can help us understand how we learn as human beings.

-    The general public thinks companies like Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and other large car companies are the ones who is inventing self-driving cars with amazing features. However, we should never forget the researchers, such as Geoffery Hilton, who made the modern technology possible.
